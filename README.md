# Craigslist Responsive Redesign
## UI UX Fall 2022

# Link to deployed site:
k-walsh.github.io/craigslist

Note that the site is not completely interactive (not all links work, can't sign in, etc) because the point of this project was to redesign an existing website to make it more responsive, not to build functionality to make it a working site. Thus, this project could be continued to make a full, working version. Feel free to check it out on tablet and mobile devices to see the responsiveness!
